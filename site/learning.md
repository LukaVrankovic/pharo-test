## Testimonies

Some of the lectures are based on an excellent lecture freely available at [http://mooc.pharo.org](http://mooc.pharo.org). 
Here are some testimonies:
- I have just completed week seven of the Pharo Mooc (beginner and object-oriented tracks) I am starting a redo of the Mooc with the web track (TinyBlog project). I have already learned so much! I have spent the last 20 years or so in software development and, following this Mooc, I realized I hadn’t really grasped the essence of object-oriented design. - Anonymous
- « Really one of the best mooc I have ever attended. And I have attended quite a few (openSAP, openHPI). As an old fashioned ABAP developer, I want to be reborn as Pharo developer in my next life :-) » - Anonymous
- Hi! I finished the MOOC some weeks ago and I would like to congratulate everybody involved! After a decade+ of Python programming, I think I found my new favorite language :). I'm making a small Teapot server for Slack command bots, I'm gonna push it to Github (yay Iceberg), if anyone is interested. - EduardoPadoan
- I just completed the @pharoproject Mooc the best investment I have ever made of my time. -MAQBOOL
- Hey all - I've just finished the Mooc \- thanks for an excellent course and a thouroughly interesting look at a new way to program :smile: Looking forward to starting to play with Pharo on some upcoming ideas I've had. - Tieryn
- As much as I thought I understand object-orientation, it is very clear NOW that without a truly useable Smalltalk, which Pharo is, it is impossible to really understand and exercise object orientation. Thank you all soooo much. - Mike D. 06/12/2020
